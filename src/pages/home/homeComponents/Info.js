        I am a small business based in Paramount, CA. I do eyebrow Lamination
        and Henna (tweezers). I don't use any type of glue on brows. Lamination
        allows the eyebrows to be styled the way you want. I provide a free
        sample of caster oil to condition your brows allowing them to remain
        healthy. To help achieve a better look for your brows, I recommend using
        brow gel/soap.
