          I am a small business based in Paramount, CA. I do eyebrow Lamination
          and Henna (tweezers). I don't use any type of glue on brows.
          Lamination allows the eyebrows to be styled the way you want. I
          provide a free sample of caster oil to condition your brows allowing
          them to remain healthy. To help achieve a better look for your brows,
          I recommend using brow gel/soap.
